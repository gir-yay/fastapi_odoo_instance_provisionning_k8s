# FastAPI Odoo Instance Manager (Kubernetes Version)

This repository contains a FastAPI application providing CRUD endpoints for managing Odoo instances on self-manged Kubernetes Cluster on DigitalOcean. Users can sign up, sign in, and request Odoo instances that run entirely within a DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster, including both Odoo and PostgreSQL deployments.



### Note:
 This repo is another version of [THis Github Repo](https://github.com/gir-yay/fastapi_infra_provisionning) where instead of working with a Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure, we are working with a k8s cluster.
